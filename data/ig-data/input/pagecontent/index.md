### About FHIR and IBM Health Data Connect

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (**FHIR**) is a standard for healthcare data exchange, published by the [Health Level Seven International](http://www.hl7.org/) (HL7®) standards organization. 

To build upon FHIR standards,  [IBM® Watson Health](https://www.ibm.com/watson-health) has developed **IBM® Health Data Connect**. This Common Data Model Implementation Guide supports Health Data Connect data interoperability for a cross-section of healthcare use cases, and refers to the model defined by this implementation guide as the IBM Health Data Connect Common Data Model. 


### About the Common Data Model

The Common Data Model extends the industry-standard, base FHIR specification to support the data model requirements needed by healthcare data platform base capabilities, for example, data lineage and resource matching. In addition, the Common Data Model adds elements to support higher-level value that can be driven by a healthcare data platform, including claims data enrichment, care gap analytics, and patient engagement.
